# SQL_CHALLENGE
 I recently took part in the 15-Day SQL Challenge by PrepVector, where I solved real-world SQL problems using concepts like CTEs, window functions, and subqueries.

It wasn’t just about writing queries  I also got to think about the business impact behind each solution, which made it even more meaningful to connect SQL with real-world scenarios.

I’ve compiled day-wise PDFs including the question, schema, and my solutions.
Would love to hear your thoughts on these problems and discuss your approach too  feel free to connect on my linkedin - https://www.linkedin.com/in/sai-sri-maddirala-bb88331b5/
