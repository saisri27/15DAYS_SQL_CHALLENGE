# SQL_CHALLENGE

I recently completed the 15-Day SQL Challenge by PrepVector, where I tackled real-world SQL problems using concepts like CTEs, window functions, subqueries, and more.

What made this challenge even more impactful was not just solving queries, but also reflecting on the business value behind each solution ,a great way to connect SQL logic with real-world applications.

I've compiled day-wise PDFs including the questions, table schema, and my solutions.
Would love to hear your thoughts and discuss different approaches â€” feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/sai-sri-maddirala-bb88331b5/)

This challenge was organized by Manisha Arora, Siddarth Ranganathan, and Venkata Sai Kumar Bysani from PrepVector. You can check it out here [ PrepVector SQL Challenge](https://challenges.prepvector.com/challenges]
